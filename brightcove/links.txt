EXPECTATIONS:

It is desirable to get back an error free code solution from the candidate, however we are more interested in knowing the candidate’s thought process on how he/ she arrived at that particular solution.
Please make sure to write back to us with your though process along with the code samples, as this may be an important factor in the selection process.

ALL THE BEST and HAPPY CODING !!!!
