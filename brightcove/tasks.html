	<h2>Expectations</h2>
	<p>It is desirable to get back an error free code solution from the candidate, however we are more interested in knowing the candidate's thought process on how he/ she arrived at that particular solution.</p>
	<p>Please make sure to write back to us with your though process along with the code samples, as this may be an important factor in the selection process.</p>
	<p>ALL THE BEST and HAPPY CODING !!!!</p>
